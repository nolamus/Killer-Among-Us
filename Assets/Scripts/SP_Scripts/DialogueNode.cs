/*  SCRIPT COMMENTED OUT:
This method of creating a dialogue tree within Unity itself proved to be tedious.
Instead, Ink (a powerful scripting language), was used for the dialogue tree. This
script has been commented out in order to prevent it from affecting Editor settings
and increasing compile time.
